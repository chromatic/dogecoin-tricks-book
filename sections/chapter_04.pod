=head0 Inside the Dogecoin Core

Dogecoin is a lot of things. One of those things is the Dogecoin Core wallet.
While anyone can write or run their own client, this code is the first client
among equals.

This is good, in that it's tested, observed, analyzed, and deployed widely.
It's risky, in that Dogecoin belongs to everyone who participates. Fortunately,
the code is open and available for anyone to read, study, adapt, modify on
their own, and suggest changes.

That includes you.
