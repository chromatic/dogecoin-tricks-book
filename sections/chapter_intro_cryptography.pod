=head0 Understanding Cryptography

Wow, that sounds yawn-inducing!

Cryptography is fundamental to cryptocurrency. That's what "crypto" in the name
meansN<Crypto as in "hidden", not "graveyards", but if you want to be spooky
and do Dogecoin, that's cool too!>. While you don't have to understand all of
the deeply mathematical details of elliptic curves, public/private key ciphers,
and Merkle trees, knowing the basics of I<how> everything works and fits
together will help you be safer and more secure as well as have more fun
learning about Dogecoin and cryptocurrency.

You'll need a couple of sharp pencils, some paper, and a hand calculator--or a
good spreadsheet, if you're comfortable with that. Set aside some space to work
and keep an open mind.

While this chapter intends to explain the fundamentals of cryptography, it's
not going to make a rigorous, mathematically-sound attempt. It's going to use
analogy and example so you'll get a feel for how things fit together. This
won't provide the same security as things cryptographers do all day every day;
it's intended to explain and entertain, not secure.
