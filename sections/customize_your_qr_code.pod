=head1 Customize Your QR Code

Z<customize_your_qr_code>

Your pinball arcade is doing great (see L<generate_a_qr_code>), but there's
something missing. Your branding feels generic. You want more sizzle, besides
the flashing lights, the satisfying thunk of a steel ball on a waxed playfield,
and that horrible knocking sound whenever someone wins a free credit.

How about customizing your QR codes? Add your logo or a meme or something
otherwise exciting, surprising, or attractive to make your payment experience
more magical!

=head2 *Write a Little Custom Code

X<< Python libraries; C<qrcode> >>
X<< Python libraries; C<pillow> >>

You need two Python libraries for this, C<qrcode> and Pillow. If you installed
C<qrcode> yourself, run C<python3 -m pip install "qrcode[pil]"> to install
Pillow. Otherwise, check your package manager manages Python for you. With
everything installed, write this little program:

=begin programlisting

    #!/usr/bin/env python3

    import qrcode
    from qrcode.image.styledpil import StyledPilImage
    from qrcode.image.styles.moduledrawers.pil \
        import RoundedModuleDrawer
    from qrcode.image.styles.colormasks import RadialGradiantColorMask
    from qrcode.constants import ERROR_CORRECT_L
    from sys import argv

    def main(address, logo):
        qr = qrcode.QRCode(error_correction=ERROR_CORRECT_L)
        qr.add_data(address)

        qr.make_image(
            image_factory=StyledPilImage,
            module_drawer=RoundedModuleDrawer(),
            color_mask=RadialGradiantColorMask(),
            embeded_image_path=logo,
        ).save("qr" + address + ".png")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main(argv[1], argv[2])

=end programlisting

Run this with arguments something like:

=begin screen

  $ B<python3 custom-qr-code.py DAY5w... images/chromatic-shibe.png>

=end screen

=begin figure An Eye-Popping, Bedazzling QR Code

Z<figure-dogecoin-custom-qr-code>

F<images/dogecoin-custom-qr-code.png>

=end figure

This will generate the QR code shown in L<figure-dogecoin-custom-qr-code>, with
the QR code for this book's homepage and the fantastic junior developer shibe
puppet from L<put_your_face_on_your_wallet>. Print, share, send to an e-ink
display, paint on a wall, do whatever you want with this--but remember, if you
use I<this> logo, any funds go to the author's wallet!

=head2 *Understand the Risks

This code enhances the C<qrcode> image to round the image's edges, add a color
gradient to the QR code, and embed your logo in middle of the image. The result
gets written out with a predictable name, suitable for printing, including in a
website, et cetera. The more complex you make your QR code--especially if you
use a large or complex additional image--the greater the chance that a QR
reader will fail to read it appropriately. Test your image on multiple devices
for looks I<and> behavior.
