=head0 Running Your Own Node

You can do a lot with Dogecoin if you let someone else manage your wallet--by
keeping your coins on an exchange, for example--but taking control of your own
coins gives you a lot of power and security. While this may initially seem
risky daunting, it can be both easier and safer than you think, and it gives
you a lot more options.

This chapter demonstrates interesting things you can do when you download the
Dogecoin Core software and use it to run your own node.
