=head0 Running Your Own Node

Dogecoin gives you as much or as little control and custody of your funds as
you like. You can delegate management of everything to an exchange, for
example, or you can run your own node and have complete control over your funds
and even how the network as a whole operators. While taking matters into your own
hands may seem complex, risky, and daunting, it can be both easier and safer
than you think, and it gives you a lot more options.

This chapter demonstrates interesting things you can do when you download the
Dogecoin Core software and use it to run your own node.
