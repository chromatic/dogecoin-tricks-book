=head0 Getting Data from a Local Node

When you run your own node, you can do more than mine blocks and keep the
network healthy. You get insight into the current, past, and future state of
the network.

This is powerful. You do not have to rely on someone else to tell you what's
happening, what might happen, or what has happened. All of your data is in your
own hands, with no one modifying it behind your back, charging you for access,
or keeping track of what you're doing.

Here's how.

L<enhance_rpc_calls>

L<take_actions_on_new_blocks>

L<add_an_action_launcher>

L<add_desktop_notifications>
