=head0 Inside the Dogecoin Core

Z<chapter_inside_the_dogecoin_core>

Dogecoin is a lot of things, and one is the Dogecoin Core wallet. There is no
such thing as an "official" wallet or "official" implementation of Dogecoin.
Dogecoin is a protocol and a network and the consensus of everyone who
participates in producing, consuming, relaying, and mining transactions and
blocks. Anyone can write or modify or run their own client.

Yet the Dogecoin Core was the first client, and it remains one of the most
popular. Anyone can read its code, modify it, suggest changes, and even verify
that the code as published is the same code that builds the binaries. This is
good, in that it's tested, observed, analyzed, and deployed widely. It's risky,
in that Dogecoin belongs to everyone who participates, regardless of their
intentions.

Fortunately, the phrase "anyone can contribute" is true--and it requires less
skill, time, and effort than you might think. Your experience and insights and
suggestions are valuable to Dogecoin and the Dogecoin Core.
