A Dogecoin wallet isn't a pouch full of paper wads and metal lumps. Neither is
it a ledger of incoming and outgoing transactions. It I<is> a list of numbers
and descriptions. Those are public and private keys and any labels you've
attached to them.

Even though that sounds deceptively simple (and doesn't translate directly to
the contents of your pocket or your bank account), the contents of your wallet
are important. They give (or you) access to the Dogecoin you can spend. What
you do or don't do with them can make the difference between having Dogecoin
and watching someone else spend it.

Here's how to work with your wallet well, from keeping it secure to receiving
payments safely to recovering from potential catastrophe.
