=head0 Working With Wallets

A Dogecoin wallet isn't a pouch full of metal coins and wads of paper. Neither
is it a ledger of incoming and outgoing transactions. It I<is> a list of
numbers and descriptions, but those are public and private keys and any labels
you've attached to them.

Even though that sounds deceptively simple (and doesn't translate directly to
the contents of your pocket or your bank account), the contents of your wallet
are important. In fact, those contents are what give you (or deny you) access
to the Dogecoin you control.

Here's how to work with your wallet well.
