=head0 *Preface

Dogecoin is the Internet's original meme-based cryptocurrency.

That sentence may read like a bunch of nerdy nonsense to you. Don't worry; it
is! Fortunately, this book will make it clearer. It'll still be a bunch of
nerdy nonsense, but you'll understand it and be able to have fun, do cool
things, and show off your new knowledge to friends at partiesN<Talk about other
things too; we want you invited I<back>.>.

Let's explain that first sentence.

Dogecoin is what we're talking about.

The Internet is a globally-distributed network of computers that lets people
and machines communicate in words, pictures, video, audio, and all kinds of
data.

X<meme>

A meme is an idea, usually clever or ironic or sarcastic or joking, that's
easily spread between people. It often takes the form of an image or video that
can be shared on the Internet.

X<cryptocurrency>

Cryptocurrency is a mechanism to record digital transactions over the Internet
between people who don't necessarily trust each other as individuals but, as a
group, agree to specific ways to communicate that ideally make the entire
network of people trustworthy enough to serve as a mechanism of financial
exchange.

Whew.

The crypto stuff is interesting, and there's a lot to learn if you want, but
most of it summarizes to this: you don't have to take someone's word that
they're trustworthy. You should be able to verify it.

If that sounds like a lot of work with a bunch of serious nerds doing serious
nerd stuff, remember that there's a friendly dog mascot with a bunch of silly
memes and the whole point is to have fun.

That's what this book is about.

=begin sidebar What do I need?

This book assumes you have access to a computer somewhere (though some of the
tricks will work on mobile devices such as phones and tablets), have access to
the Internet, and can download and install and run software.

X<Dogecoin Core; trustworthy links>

At the time of this writing, you can visit U<dogecoin.com> for links and
information about how to download and run the official Dogecoin Core. Don't
take our word for it though; check online if that's still the official home of
the official Core. Test that against other sites such as
U<https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin>, the Dogecoin Reddit at
U<https://reddit.com/r/dogecoin/> and other locations. If something seems off
to you ask questions.
