=head0 *Preface

Dogecoin is the Internet's original meme-based cryptocurrency.

That sentence may read like a bunch of nerdy nonsense to you. Don't worry; it
is! Fortunately, this book will make it clearer. It'll still be a bunch of
nerdy nonsense, but you'll understand it and be able to have fun, do cool
things, and show off your new knowledge to friends at partiesN<Talk about other
things too; we want you invited I<back>.>.

Let's explain that first sentence.

Dogecoin is what we're talking about.

The Internet is a globally-distributed network of computers that lets people
and machines communicate in words, pictures, video, audio, and all kinds of
data.

X<meme>

A meme is an idea, usually clever or ironic or sarcastic or joking, that's
easily spread between people. It often takes the form of an image or video that
can be shared on the Internet.

X<cryptocurrency>

Cryptocurrency is a mechanism to record digital transactions over the Internet
between people who don't necessarily trust each other as individuals but, as a
group, agree to specific ways to communicate that ideally make the entire
network of people trustworthy enough to serve as a mechanism of financial
exchange.

Whew.

The crypto stuff is interesting, and there's a lot to learn if you want, but
most of it summarizes to this: you don't have to take someone's word that
they're trustworthy. You should be able to verify it.

If that sounds like a lot of work with a bunch of serious nerds doing serious
nerd stuff, remember that there's a friendly dog mascot with a bunch of silly
memes and the whole point is to have fun.

That's what this book is about.

=begin sidebar What do I need?

This book assumes you have access to a computer somewhere (though some of the
tricks will work on mobile devices such as phones and tablets), have access to
the Internet, and can download and install and run software.

X<Dogecoin Core; trustworthy links>

At the time of this writing, you can visit U<dogecoin.com> for links and
information about how to download and run the official Dogecoin Core. Don't
take our word for it though; check online if that's still the official home of
the official Core. Test that against other sites such as
U<https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin>, the Dogecoin Reddit at
U<https://reddit.com/r/dogecoin/> and other locations. If something seems off
to you, then ask questions. Honest, helpful people will give you good answers
and help you verify them for yourself.

=head1 *How to Read This Book

A cryptocurrency with a friendly dog mascot is supposed to be I<fun>, so you
should read this book in a way that you enjoy. Maybe that's front to back or
back to front or skipping around. Maybe you read a couple of pages before going
to sleep to relax you or teach your brain a lesson. The only I<wrong> way to
read this book is a way that you don't enjoy.

In general, the book starts by assuming you're new to cryptography,
cryptocurrency, and Dogecoin. Earlier pages introduce concepts that later pages
build on, but it's totally okay to skip around. Skim the table of contents.
Look at the names of every chapter and every tip. If something grabs your
attention, read that first. Repeat.

This book also tries to express links between concepts, ideas, and tips.
Sometimes something introduced earlier will show up later, and sometimes you'll
see similar themes repeated throughout the book. That's on purpose. It's just
as valid to breeze through this book on a lazy summer afternoon as it is to
skim through it over the period of weeks, months, or years. Feel free to set it
down and come back to it later; all of the information will be waiting for you,
and ideally each tip has enough breadcrumbs to point to other places that you
can remind yourself where you were in your journey at the time.

Put this book on your bedside table. Face it out on from the bookshelf behind
you when you're on video calls. Carry it when you're walking, riding the train,
or enjoying a cannolo from a park bench downtown. Lend a copy to your friends
and donate a copy to your local library. Above all, embrace the fun. Your
author believes that learning things can be enjoyable and being in control of
your own coins is liberating and powerful. There's a lot to learn, but it
doesn't have to be intimidating. It can be fun and playful.
