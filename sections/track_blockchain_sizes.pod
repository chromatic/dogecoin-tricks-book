=head1 Track Blockchain Sizes

Z<track_blockchain_sizes>

You never have to ask permission to participate in Dogecoin, but your ability
to participate may have a cost. To run a node or a miner, you must account for
electricity, bandwidth, disk space, and routine maintenance to keep things
running. Sometimes this is a thankless task, but it helps you and the
community.

What does it take to make the network work? We can measure that!

=head2 *Count All the Unspent Transactions

Other tips explain how important the entire blockchain is essential to proving
that any given transaction belongs to the network (see L<forge_a_chain>, for
example). Even though every block in the chain validates every future block,
some blocks and transactions supersede others. Any transaction where the
recipients have spent all the outputs (see L<bundle_and_track_transactions>) is
useful for verifying historical accuracy, but it's not essential for checking
the validity of any new proposed transaction.

X<concepts; UTXOs>

In other words, to validate a new transaction, the network has to prove that
its inputs (the coins it proposes to spend) all come from unspent outputs of
existing transactions. These are I<UTXO>s, or Unspent Transaction Outputs. A
node doesn't have to track every transaction or block everywhere to validate
any new transaction; it only has to track all UTXOs.

The set of all UTXOs grows and shrinks over time. If you receive 10,000 Doge
from mining a block and then create two transactions, one sending 5,000 Doge to
your cold wallet and another sending 5,000 to your favorite Uncle Oscar, you've
replaced one transaction with unspent outputs (the coinbase transaction) with
two (one to your cold wallet and another to Oscar).

If you've received a hundred tips to a wallet address and you decide to sweep
them all to a cold wallet in one transaction, you may replace 100 UTXOs with
oneN<Note that this example doesn't account for transaction fees paid to
miners.>.

X<< RPC commands; C<gettxoutsetinfo> >>

There's no I<theoretical> limit to the maximum total number of UTXOs. Instead
there's a I<practical> limit of how many the average node can store. To see
what's currently happening in the network, use the C<gettxoutsetinfo> RPC
command to inspect the I<current> set of UTXOs. This will take several seconds
to return a result resembling:

=begin screen

  {
    "height": 4667058,
    "bestblock": "5fe7bc...",
    "transactions": 8281767,
    "txouts": 17644750,
    "bytes_serialized": 769053979,
    "hash_serialized": "eae241...",
    "total_amount": 138843085485.95428675
  }

=end screen

This output shows 8.28 million transactions with unspent outputs and 17.64
million unspent outputs in those transactions, with 138.843 billion (billion
with a b) Dogecoin available for spending.

=head2 *Count All the Dogecoin

Want to know how many Dogecoin are available? You just did! Great work!

Although it gets I<slightly> more complicated: not all of these coins can be
spent. People may lose their wallets and keys. Some coins may be locked up
until a point in the future. Others were sent to addresses where there can be
no keys. Even still, an estimate is a good start.

=head2 *Measure Disk and Memory Consumption

X<< RPC commands; C<getmemoryinfo> >>

Disk space and memory aren't free. What does it cost to run a node? For
example, how much memory does your node use to track UTXOs? Use
C<getmemoryinfo> for a hint:

=begin screen

  {
    "locked": {
      "used": 14687328,
      "free": 254880,
      "total": 14942208,
      "locked": 14942208,
      "chunks_used": 458979,
      "chunks_free": 3
    }
  }

=end screen

This node uses 14,687,328 bytes of memory of 14,942,208 bytes available. If
you're running the GUI, you'll need more than that, but this is a start of an
estimate.

How much disk space are you using? Again, an exact example is difficult to get.
With Dogecoin Core 1.14.x, the C<bytes_serialized> value returned from
C<gettxoutsetinfo> shows the size in bytes of the UTXO set as stored on disk,
more or less. In newer versions of Dogecoin Core (1.21.x and newer), this
single value will become C<bogosize> and C<disk_size> with more accuracy.  In
the previous example, the Core returned a value of 769,053,979 bytes: around
7.7 MB on disk.

X<GIF; how to pronounce correctly>

If you're running a node, you can use your operating system's file utilities to
get a better sense of how much space on disk your node uses to store the
blockchain. As of this writing in early April 2023, a full node consumes about
64 GB (gigabytesN<That's gigabytes with a hard-g, not a soft-g like GIF.>) of
disk space.

=head2 *Understand the Risks

Besides the risks of running a Core node that may lead you to separate your
wallet from the node, you need RAM, disk space, and bandwidth to participate in
the network. These aren't free. Neither is electricity. Your participation is
valuable--essential, even. Without multiple cooperating well-behaved shibes, a
few bad actors could control all of the transactions.

Consider how much you're willing to invest in keeping Dogecoin independent and
permissionless. Use what you've learned here to monitor what's happening
regularly, lest any changes catch you by surprise.
