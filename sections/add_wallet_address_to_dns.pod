=head1 Add a Wallet Address to a DNS Record

Z<add_wallet_address_to_dns>

If you have a website, like U<https://ifdogethenwow.com/>, how can people find
you and send you a tip or a payment for something awesome you've done?

You need some way to associate a Dogecoin address with an Internet property.

Fortunately, the Internet already has a well-understood mechanism to add this
kind of metadata to a domain name. It's the same way any device can turn that
domain name into an IP address or addresses to look up a web page, send email,
make an SSH connection, or do other things.

At the inagural Dogecoin
hackathonN<U<https://foundation.dogecoin.com/announcements/2022-09-08-dogeathon-downunder/>>,
Timothy Stebbing showed off this idea.

Here's how to make it work.

=head2 *How to Add a TXT Record

First, generate a new, unique Dogecoin address. Use the Dogecoin Core,
C<libdogecoin>, or a non-custodial wallet you trust. Keep the private key safe,
as always.

Second, take a domain name you control. Maybe that's C<mycoolsite.example> or
something else. You've registered this through a domain registrar, and you have
the ability to configure DNS.

=begin tip Keep Your Domain Running!

If you didn't set up your own DNS, talk to the person or people who set it up
for you. If you edit this on your own and make a mistake, you could break your
website, email, or other network services associated with that domain.

=end tip

Now go into your DNS configuration and add a `TXT` record. This is an arbitrary
text string associated with your domain name and propagated through the
globally-accessible, cached DNS system.

For now, stick with the defaults of I<which> DNS entry, TTL settings, et
cetera.

The contents of this new record should be the literal string `dogecoin:` (yes,
include the colon) plus the new wallet address you generated, with no spaces in
between. This conforms to BIP
21N<U<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki>>, so
other applications can use this. Hold onto that thought.

Save the configuration and publish it and you're good to go.

=begin tip Specific DNS Configuration Details See... Elsewhere

Looking for a visual explanation of how to do this? The process varies
depending on your domain registrar and DNS host. Again, this has the potential
to render your domain I<temporarily> unusable, so this tip won't go into much
more detail.

This might change in the future.

=end tip

When this change makes its way through DNS, anyone will be able to look up your
domain name, find this new record, and do something with this wallet address.

=head2 *Understand the Risks

At this point in the book, you should be a little bit wary of the words
I<anyone> and I<something>, because publishing an address like this means
anyone can do I<anything> with both the address and the knowledge the address
is associated with the domain name.

DNS entries often contain contact information for the person managing the
domain. While many registrars allow domain security and privacy to hide your
personal information, some don't. Before you add this record, check your DNS
settings with a DNS lookup tool like the C<whois> command-line tool or a
reputable website.

You I<can> of course add this record even if you have contact information
recorded, but be mindful of the fact that any transaction to and from this
address can be associated with the domain contact permanently.

You should also be aware that DNS as originally designed has potential security
flaws, including spoofing. If you're concerned about this potential flaw, make
sure you've configured DNSSEC correctly.

Finally, if you fail to renew your domain or someone snatches it up out from
under you, they can swap their address for yours in their configuration, in the
same way that they could swap their website for yours if you lose control of
your domain name.

=head2 *What Can You Do With This?

Apart from being an interesting forehead-slapper of a trickN<In the sense that,
"Oh yeah, you could totally do this!">, the value of this trick is in the
integrations it enables.

Imagine a web browser extension that could show you a Dogecoin tip address
whenever you visited, if the site owner had one configured. If you like the
site, throw a few Doge their way, right from your browser or device.

Or imagine we repurposed this record to point to a text file or structured data
file on the server, served over HTTPS, that gave access information, purchase
data, or other suggestions, like "If you send 10 Doge to this address, you'll
get 24 hours of access" for a news site or something.

Consider also an alternate approach. C<ifdogethenwow.com> has, as of this
writing, the main domain (just that) and a well-knownN<Okay okay, hear me out
though!> subdomain of C<blog.ifdogethenwow.com>. Any and every subdomain could have its own
TXT record with a unique wallet address.

An enterprising shibe could start a site called C<shibetips.whatever> and, for
a small fee or out of the goodness of their hearts, allow users I<optionally>
to associate an address with a subdomain. Again, keep in mind the security and
privacy implications, but think of the possibilities.
