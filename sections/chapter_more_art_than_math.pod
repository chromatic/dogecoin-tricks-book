Z<chapter_more_art_than_math>

dogecoin and cryptocurrency build on a foundation of deep math and security to
exist, run, and ensure the safety and transparency of public information. Yet
you don't have to focus on the math and security and networking with everything
you do. Sometimes it's more fun to focus on the odd, the bizarre, the
unexpected, and the surprising.

In this chapter you'll find several ideas both fully compatible with
cryptocurrency and Dogecoin I<and> which bring ancillary, unique, weird, and
perhaps even silly perspectives to your work with the coin.
