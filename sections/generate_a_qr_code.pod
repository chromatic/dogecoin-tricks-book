=head1 Generate a QR Code

Z<generate_a_qr_code>

If you take Dogecoin payments in some kind of in-person setting, you probably
want an easy way to allow people to send you payments without talking through
an entire wallet address out loudN<"That's D as in Doge, K as in Kabosu, no I
don't want to say Donkey Kong, just trust me.">.

This is even more important when you want to remove some degree of human
intervention from the process. Suppose you have a pinball arcade and you want
to allow people to pay with quarters I<or> with Dogecoin (see
L<chapter_dogecade>). How can you accept payments with as little friction as
possible? A Bitcoin Improvement Proposal has the answer.

=head2 *Dogecoin-Aware Wallet Links

X<BIPs; BIP-21>

As defined in BIP-21N<See
U<https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0021.mediawiki>.>, a
hyperlink starting with C<bitcoin:> and followed by an address tells your
computer, phone, tablet, or other device to open some sort of wallet
application and prepare to send a transaction to the given address.

Dogecoin adopted this obviously good idea.

If you are, for example, selling electronic copies of a book about Dogecoin
online, you might create a BIP-21 address such as
C<dogecoin:DAY5wNkebzEyqUXCkN9koKNBuzXRKRTjcL> to receive funds. If someone
clicks on that link on a device that understands that format, their wallet will
prompt them to decide whether to complete the transaction.

That works well on a web page, but if you're in this amazing Doge-aware pinball
arcade, do you really want to pull up a webpage and search for the right link
when you turn the corner and see the incredibly rare Baby Pac-Man! machine you
weren't sure if you imagined in a dream?

Wouldn't it be more fun to snap a pic and then start playing?

=head2 *Dogecoin-Aware Images

X<QR code>

You're probably already familiar with QR codes, the three-dimensional barcode
looking images that contain arbitrary data and take you to real estate listings
or menus in restaurants that don't want to hand out grubby menus. You may
already have seen that the Dogecoin Core creates both a BIP-21 address and a QR
code when you ask it to produce a receiving address. That's not always 100%
convenient (What if you're using an offline wallet? What if you don't have the
Core available? What if you don't have the Core GUI running?)

You can make your own QR code with your own address.

While multiple websites purport to generate QR codes for you, you shouldn't
have to trust a third-party to do it right. While you can and should
double-check with your own phone or device that the code contains the link you
want, it's important to be able to use these tools on your own too.

X<< Python libraries; C<qrcode> >>
X<< external programs; C<qr> >>

Many programming languages can generate QR codes, such as good tool is the
Python module C<qrcode>N<See U<https://pypi.org/project/qrcode/> for more
details.>. This module includes an easy to use command-line utility called
C<qr>:

=begin screen

  $ B<qr 'dogecoin:DAY5wNkebzEyqUXCkN9koKNBuzXRKRTjcL'` \>
    B<< > book-address-qr.png >>

=end screen

This will write a PNG file as output containing the QR code encoding the
address. If your terminal supports image output, you can test the command by
skipping the file redirection and pointing your phone at the screen, as shown
in L<figure-dogecoin-qr-code-generation>.

=begin figure Generate a QR Code from the Command Line

Z<figure-dogecoin-qr-code-generation>

=end figure

=begin tip Install Python and qrcode Simply

IF you already have Python 3 installed, use C<python3 -m pip install qrcode>.
If you don't have Python 3 installed, download an installer from
U<https://platform.activestate.com/chromatic/Python-QR-Codes> for Linux, Mac,
and Windows systems.

=end tip

=head2 *Understand the Risks

With a QR code, you can take payments from a variety of devices with reduced
human interaction. That's great, but the link in the QR code is now the entry
point to your payments. Always check and double-check that the embedded link is
a BIP-21 link that contains I<your> address.

If you print these QR codes to attach to your pinball machines, be sure to do
so in a way that doesn't hurt the paint. Attach them to glass or metal surfaces
with the appropriate adhesive. You'll thank yourself later.

Printing QR codes runs the risk of re-using addresses. While it's much, much
safer to generate new addresses for each transaction, you may find this risk is
worthwhile to reduce the need for human interaction for every pinball play. If
you do go this route, rotate your addresses (see L<rotate_machine_addresses>)
and generate new QR codes frequently (weekly? monthly?).

Finally, be aware that a payment system that relies on people scanning codes
with their phones is susceptible to the risk that someone may print out their
own QR codes and stick them over the top of your own codes, sort of like an ATM
skimmer. Watch your machines carefully.
