=head0 Dogecoin in the World

Watching numbers change on a computer can be soothing or fulfilling for a
while, but eventually the physical needs of being human intervene. While
Dogecoin's original purpose was to poke fun at cryptocurrency and the people
who took cryptocurrency far too seriously, the very real human needs of utility
(including having fun) are serious business.

This chapter explores what Dogecoin means in the world through various lenses.
A word of warning, however: while some people treat Dogecoin or cryptocurrency
in general as an investment that will make them rich, this book takes a
different approach. Things are good if they are I<useful> and I<enjoyable> for
reasons beyond numbers going up in an account somewhere.
