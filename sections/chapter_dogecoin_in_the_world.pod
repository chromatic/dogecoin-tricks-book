Z<chapter_dogecoin_in_the_world>

Watching numbers change on a computer can be soothing or fulfilling for a
while, but eventually the physical needs of being human intervene. While
Dogecoin's originally poked fun at cryptocurrency and people who take
cryptocurrency far too seriously, the very real human needs of utility
(including having fun) are serious business.

This chapter explores what Dogecoin can mean in the world. A word of warning,
however: some people treat cryptocurrency and Dogecoin as a get-rich-quick
investment. This book takes a different approach. Good things are I<useful> and
I<enjoyable> for reasons beyond numbers going up.
