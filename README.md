This is the repository for a book called Dogecoin Tricks. The book will contain
101 interesting, useful, informative, and/or unique things you can do with
Dogecoin.

Currently this is a work in progress. Feel free to use issues or pull requests
to suggest an idea for a trick, contribute something new, or propose a change
to something already written.

## About the Book

The book is written in a markup language called
[PseudoPod](https://metacpan.org/dist/Pod-PseudoPod/view/lib/Pod/PseudoPod/Tutorial.pod)
which is flexible and easy to manage. It also uses tooling called
[Pod::PseudoPod::Book](https://metacpan.org/dist/Pod-PseudoPod-Book) to bundle
all of the files and produce output in various formulas, including camera-ready
PDF.

If you already have a modern version of Perl installed (preferred 5.32 or
newer), install `Pod::PseudoPod::Book` to get started. Otherwise, see
[chromatic/Dogecoin-Tricks-Book-Contrib](https://platform.activestate.com/chromatic/Dogecoin-Tricks-Book-Contrib) for
a precompiled bundle of code that will work with this project.

The commands `ppbook buildhtml`, `ppbook buildpdf`, and `ppbook buildepub` will
produce the requested output formats if all goes well.
